# BloodMdl

Welcome to the **BloodMdl** GitHub page! We are developing an advanced **blood damage prediction model** for blood-contacting devices such as stents, valves, and mechanical circulatory devices (MCDs). Our mission is to provide more accurate predictions of blood damage by integrating advanced fluid dynamics factors.

## Mission

At **BloodMdl**, our goal is to improve the safety and performance of blood-contacting devices by predicting blood damage using a refined model. This model incorporates key factors like **shear stress**, **extensional stress**, **stress frequency**, and **stress rate** to help clinicians make more informed decisions regarding device selection and patient monitoring.
