BloodMdl
Welcome to the BloodMdl GitHub page! We are developing an advanced blood damage prediction model for blood-contacting devices like stents, valves, and mechanical circulatory devices (MCDs). Our mission is to provide more accurate predictions of blood damage by incorporating advanced fluid dynamics factors.
